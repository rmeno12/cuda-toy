# cuda-toy

The goal of this project is to implement a simple neural network in C++ that is GPU accelerated via CUDA.

### Goals
- [WIP] Implement non-accelerated net
- Optimize net architecture a little for MNIST data
- Implement CUDA-accelerated matrix functions
- Quantitatively compare accelerated vs non-accelerated performance
